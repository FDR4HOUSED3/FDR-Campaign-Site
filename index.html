    <h1>A Statement to the People of Evergreen</h1>

    <p class="fireside-quote">
      “The only thing we have to fear is… fear itself.”
    </p>

<p>
  This campaign is founded on a simple belief: <strong>putting America first</strong>. Democratic government
  must be equal to the challenges of its time. When economic uncertainty
  threatens the security of our families and communities, leadership must act
  deliberately, and with confidence in the American people.
</p>


    <p>
      America has faced crisis before. Each time, the nation has endured not
      through division, but through unity of purpose and shared responsibility through faith in <strong>god</strong>.

  <section class="national-purpose">
    <h2>Our Common Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of
      those who have much, but whether we provide enough for those who have too
      little. Government exists to secure opportunity, stability, and dignity
      for all who contribute to the life of the nation.
