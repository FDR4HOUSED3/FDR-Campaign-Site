    <p>
      This platform is guided by a simple principle: <strong>America must come first in the
      actions of its government.</strong> Not in rhetoric, but <strong>in results</strong>. The purpose of
      democratic government is to secure the economic independence, safety, and dignity of
      <strong>its people</strong>.

      <h2>America First Means Economic Security</h2>
      <p>
        A nation cannot be strong when its people live in fear of unemployment, debt,
        or instability. Economic security is not charity — it is the foundation of
        national independence. Government must act to protect American labor, American
        industry, and American families from forces they cannot control alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        This campaign supports policies that place domestic employment, wages, and
        industrial capacity ahead of speculative finance or foreign dependency.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Public investment to sustain employment during economic downturns</li>
        <li>Protection of American manufacturing and infrastructure</li>
        <li>Fair labor standards that reward work and productivity</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="platform-item">
      <h2>National Recovery Through American Industry</h2>
      <p>
        America First requires an economy capable of sustaining itself. Strategic
        industries essential to national strength — transportation, energy,
        construction, and manufacturing — must be supported and modernized.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recovery is not achieved by waiting for markets to correct themselves,
        but by deliberate national action that restores confidence and capacity.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Infrastructure investment using American labor and materials</li>
        <li>Support for small and mid-sized domestic businesses</li>
        <li>Long-term planning to prevent future economic collapse</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="platform-item">
      <h2>Responsible Government, Not Weak Government</h2>
      <p>
        America First does not mean government withdrawal — it means government
        responsibility. In moments of crisis, inaction is not restraint; it is
        failure. Democratic government must be capable of acting decisively
        while remaining accountable to the people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fiscal responsibility means planning for the future, not abandoning
        the present. Public resources must be used carefully, transparently,
        and with long-term national benefit in mind.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Transparent budgeting and public accountability</li>
        <li>Measured use of public spending to stabilize the economy</li>
        <li>Protection of retirement and social insurance systems</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="platform-item">
      <h2>Integrity, Law, and Democratic Trust</h2>
      <p>
        The strength of the Republic depends on trust in its institutions.
        Public office is a public trust, and no individual or interest
        stands above the law. Democratic authority must always remain
        accountable to the people.
      </p>
      <p>
        America First governance requires honest administration, independent
        courts, and respect for constitutional limits.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strong ethical standards for public officials</li>
        <li>Independent oversight and transparent decision-making</li>
        <li>Respect for constitutional governance and due process</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="platform-item">
      <h2>Public Safety and National Stability</h2>
      <p>
        Safety at home is essential to opportunity and freedom. Effective
        public safety institutions must protect communities while preserving
        civil liberties and the rule of law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stability is achieved through professionalism, fairness, and public
        confidence — not disorder or neglect.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Support for professional, accountable law enforcement</li>
        <li>Fair and consistent application of the law</li>
        <li>Investment in stable and secure communities</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="platform-item">
      <h2>America First in the World</h2>
      <p>
        America’s role in the world must serve the security and prosperity
        of <strong>our people</strong>. We are not the world police. We should not be funding foreign wars or countries when it does not directly affect the american people. This includes <strong>Israel.</strong>
         Through this, we will acquire peace through strenth, and military strength is essential.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foreign policy should avoid unnecessary conflict while ensuring
        that American independence and security are never compromised.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A strong, prepared national defense</li>
        <li>Diplomacy grounded in national interest and credibility</li>
        <li>Avoidance of reckless foreign entanglements</li>
      </ul>
